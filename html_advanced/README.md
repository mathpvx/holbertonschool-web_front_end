# Techium Project

Welcome to the Techium project! This project focuses on creating a basic webpage using HTML. The goal is to understand HTML structure and semantics without incorporating any styling or CSS.

## Wireframe

The wireframe provided for the Techium project outlines the structure of the webpage. It includes sections such as header, main content, footer, and navigation.

## Tasks Examples

### 1. Create your first webpage
   - Created `0-index.html` with a basic HTML structure including the doctype, html tag, and language specification.
   - Opened the file in the browser.

### 2. Examples of lists for the styleguide
   - Copied the content of `13-styleguide.html` into `26-styleguide.html`.
   - Added examples of unordered, ordered, and definition lists within the main section of the page.

## Guidelines

- Followed W3C compliance for HTML.
- Ensured all HTML code is lowercase and validated using the W3C Validator.
- Used semantic HTML tags to structure the webpage.
- Integrated lists, headings, and other elements according to their semantic value.
