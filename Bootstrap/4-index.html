					Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman; May 24, 1941) is an American
					singer-songwriter, author, and visual artist who has been a major
					figure in popular culture for more than fifty years.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs
					such as "Blowin' in the Wind" (1963) and "The Times They Are
					a-Changin'" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights movement and
					anti-war movement. His lyrics during this period incorporated a wide
					range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences,
					defied pop-music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning
					counterculture.

								The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the second studio album by
								American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on May 27, 1963
								by Columbia Records. Whereas his self-titled debut album Bob
								Dylan had contained only two original songs, Freewheelin'
								represented the beginning of Dylan's writing contemporary
								words to traditional melodies. Eleven of the thirteen songs on
								the album are Dylan's original compositions. The album opens
								with "Blowin' in the Wind", which became an anthem of the
								1960s, and an international hit for folk trio Peter, Paul &
								Mary soon after the release of Freewheelin'. The album
								featured several other songs which came to be regarded as
								among Dylan's best compositions and classics of the 1960s folk
								scene: "Girl from the North Country", "Masters of War", "A
								Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" and "Don't Think Twice, It's All
								Right".

								The Times They Are a-Changin' is the third studio album by
								American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on January 13,
								1964 by Columbia Records. Whereas his previous albums Bob
								Dylan and The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan consisted of original
								material among cover songs, Dylan's third album was the first
								to feature only original compositions. The album consists
								mostly of stark, sparsely arranged ballads concerning issues
								such as racism, poverty, and social change. The title track is
								one of Dylan's most famous; many feel that it captures the
								spirit of social and political upheaval that characterized the
								1960s.
